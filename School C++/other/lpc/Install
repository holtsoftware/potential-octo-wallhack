Complete installation instructions are available in the MudOS_0.9.x.tar.Z
releases (as opposed to the 0.9.x.y.tar.Z releases).  The MudOS_0.9.x.tar.Z
releases also contain documentation for efuns etc.

Short instructions:

1) edit options.h to suit your tastes
2) edit the Makefile to suit your tastes and machine requirements,
3) type: make (to build 'driver' and 'addr_server')
4) you will need a runtime config file and a mudlib in order to use the driver.
5) look at the example config file in this directory (Config.example)
6) get a MudOS-compatible mudlib such as the TMI-2 or Nightmare and read the
   instructions that come with it.
7) have fun.
