need a way to tell the driver to try reconnecting to the addr_server
after it has gone down and come back up (the addr_server).  maybe
the driver could just retry every now and then?

read_file() doesn't guarantee that a "/" is at the start of the filename
before passing to valid_read()...same problem might exist with
write_file(), read_bytes(), write_bytes(), didn't check yet

Comment:
    This problem is rather common in the driver currently.  Internally,
    filenames have no leading '/'.  One should probably be added every time
    a filename is passed to the mudlib.

hm, Linux apparently doesn't let you open a directory for reading. boggle.
so all the efuns that read from a file will screw up if you try
to use a dir as the file.  ack

    sprintf.c should probably be rewritten as it has a nasty habit of
    munging the stack and writing to places without checking the destination
    type if it's ok; probably should also remove need for setjmp/longjmp;
    also: err = setjmp(...) is non strict ANSI portable according to SAS
    tech support for their C compiler (SAS/C)

    mixed a;
    do {} while (a = ({ a, "" }));

Comment:
    It would be nice if things like this, where all the memory (VM too)
    is sucked up by a runaway program, didn't cause the driver to
    shutdown ("Out of memory").
